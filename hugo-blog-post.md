# The AI Engineering Revolution Is Here - And You're Invited üéØ

**TL;DR:** I've compiled a complete AI Engineering curriculum that takes you from zero to enterprise-ready. It's free, it's comprehensive, and it's based on what's actually working in 2024-2025.

[**üî• Access the Full Interactive Curriculum Here**](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum)

## Why This Matters Right Now

The numbers are insane:
- **$206,000** - Average AI Engineer salary (up $50K from last year)
- **24,000+** - Open positions RIGHT NOW
- **90%** - Code at leading companies is now AI-generated
- **18.7%** - Salary premium over non-AI roles

But here's the problem: Only 2.5% of these positions are entry-level. The industry desperately needs trained AI engineers, but traditional education hasn't caught up.

That's why I created this curriculum.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't another "Learn Python in 30 Days" course. This is a production-focused, industry-aligned curriculum based on:

- ‚úÖ **Real company case studies** (Bell Canada, DoorDash, Spotify)
- ‚úÖ **Latest 2024-2025 tech** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, vLLM, RAG)
- ‚úÖ **Actual production code** (not toy examples)
- ‚úÖ **Cost optimization** (save 80% on API costs)
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise deployment** (handle millions of users)

## The Four-Level Journey

### [Level 1: Using AI](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-1.html)
**Weeks 1-8: Master the Fundamentals**

Start here if you're new to AI. Learn:
- Prompt engineering that actually works (Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts)
- API integration with all major providers
- Cost optimization (reduce costs by 80%)
- Build your first production chatbot

**Real Project:** Build a chatbot that handles 1000+ concurrent users with sub-second response times.

### [Level 2: Integrating AI](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-2.html)
**Weeks 9-16: Build Intelligent Systems**

Move from single API calls to complete systems:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architectures
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)
- Multi-agent systems
- Semantic search at scale

**Real Project:** Build a document Q&A system processing 100-page documents in seconds with 95% accuracy.

### [Level 3: Engineering AI Systems](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-3.html)
**Weeks 17-24: Production-Ready Development**

Transform prototypes into bulletproof systems:
- Fine-tuning with LoRA/QLoRA (65B models on single GPU!)
- Safety guardrails and compliance
- Multi-model architectures
- Adversarial testing

**Real Project:** Fine-tune a domain-specific model achieving 40% performance improvement.

### [Level 4: Optimizing at Scale](https://jeremylongshore.github.io/ai-engineering-curriculum/level-4.html)
**Weeks 25-32: Enterprise Deployment**

Handle millions of users efficiently:
- Distributed inference (vLLM, Ray Serve)
- Edge deployment (sub-10ms latency)
- Cost vs performance optimization
- GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 compliance

**Real Project:** Deploy a system serving 1M+ requests/day with 99.9% uptime.

## Who This Is For

### Perfect If You Are:
- üë®‚Äçüíª A developer wanting to transition to AI
- üéì A CS student preparing for the job market
- üöÄ A startup founder building AI products
- üìà An engineer wanting that 18.7% salary premium
- üéØ Anyone serious about AI engineering

### You'll Need:
- Basic Python knowledge
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- ~$100 for API credits (educational discounts available)
- Dedication to practice

## What You'll Actually Build

This isn't theory - you'll build real systems:

1. **Smart Chatbot** - Handle thousands of users concurrently
2. **Content Generator** - Save 70% content creation time
3. **RAG System** - Answer questions from 1000s of documents
4. **Fine-tuned Model** - Custom AI for your specific domain
5. **Production Pipeline** - Complete MLOps implementation

## The Industry Connection

This curriculum is inspired by and incorporates:

- **"The AI Engineering Continuum"** white paper on system mastery levels
- **Real implementations** from DoorDash, Spotify, Bell Canada
- **Latest research** from NeurIPS, ICML, and industry labs
- **Production patterns** from companies processing billions of requests
